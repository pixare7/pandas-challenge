## Project Description

### District Summary
This project uses two datasets and analyzes student testing on a District level, calculating metrics such as total students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, percent of students passing math, percent of students passing reading, and the percent of students that are overall passing in both subject areas.  

### School Summary
The district is then analyzed by school.  The metrics described for the analyzed as a whole are also analyzed per school (ie: total students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, percent of students passing math, percent of students passing reading, and the percent of students that are overall passing in both subject areas). 
The schools are also compared with each other by sorting by highest rank and lowest rank in percent overall passing.  
Furthermore, we also analyze the trends in the metrics of interest by grade, school size and school type,
